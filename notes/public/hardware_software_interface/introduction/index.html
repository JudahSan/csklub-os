The Big Theme

The hardware/ software interface
How does the h/w(0s and 1s, processor executing instructions) relate to the s/w (Go programs)?
Computing is about abstractions (but we can&rsquo;t forget reality)
What are the abstractions that we use?
What do YOU need to know about them?

When do they break down and you have to peek under the hood?
What bugs can they cause and how do you find them?


Become a better programmer and begin to understand the important concepts that have evolved in building ever more complex computer systems.

Roadmap

Memory and data
Integers and floats
Machine code and C
x86 assembly
Procedures and stacks
Arrays and structs
Memory and caches
Processes
Virtual memory
Memory allocation
Java/Go vs C

Little theme 1: Representation

All digital systems represnt everything as 0s and 1s

The o and 1 are really two different voltage ranges in the electronics


Everything includes:

Numbers - integers and floating point
Character - the building blocks of strings
Instructions - the directives to the CPU that make up a program
Pointers - addresses of data objects stored away in memory


These encodings are stored throughout a computer system

In registers, caches, memories, disks, etc


They all need addresses

A way to find them
Find a new place to put a new item
Reclain the place in memory when data no longer needed



Little theme 2: Translation

There is a big gap between how we thing about programs and data and the 0s and 1s of computers
Need languages to describe what we mean
Languages need to be translated one step at a time

Word-by-word
Phrase structure
Grammar


We know Java/Go as a programming language

Have to work our way down to the 0s and 1s of computers
Try not to lose anything in translation!
We&rsquo;ll encounter Java/Go byte-code, C language, assembly language, and machine code (for the X86 family of CPU architectues)



Little theme 3: Control flow

How do computers orchestrate the many things they are doing - seemingly in parallel
What do we have to keep track of when we call a method, and then another, and then another, and so on
How do we know what to do upon &ldquo;return&rdquo;
How do we run multiple user programs and let them share a sigle computer and memory
